# iFridge
iFridge is an iOS app made for hackathon SBHacks 2020 for manually logging and tracking your refrigerator inventory and its contents' expiration dates.

## Installation
find it on the Apple App Store one day

## Usage
Start with typing in your desired item at the bottom and choosing an estimated expiration date, and it will be added to a list.
	
	- If the expiration date is beyond 2 weeks (14 days), the entry will be green
	
	- Once the expiration date is within 2 weeks, the entry will turn orange
	
	- Once the expiration date is within a week, the entry will turn red, and a notification will be pushed to notify the iFridge user of an item approaching expiration date
	
	- Once the expiration date is reached, another notification is sent out to notify the user that the item has expired
